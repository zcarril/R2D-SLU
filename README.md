# R2D-SLU
Senior Design Project for Following Robot


These are testing and actual use programs programs for my group's senior design project at Saint Louis University.

A RPLidar is used with the RPLidar library. DC motors are used with a L298N motor driver.

This is for a prototyping model, will be using different setup for final version.
